### Commits

The [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) is used to create commits.

A pattern for a commit: `<type>: <description>`, for example:

- `feat: init project`
- `fix: fix error state`
- `chore: update README.md`

It is better if the commits will be atomic, then it will be easier to navigate in the history of changes and in the design of PR, the text of the last commit will be automatically substituted in the name of the PR.
